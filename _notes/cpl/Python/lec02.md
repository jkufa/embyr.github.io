Intro To Python
===============

 + version
   - using 3.5.2
	 - on lab boxes
	 - diff 2<->3
	 - unicode support
	 - backward incompatible changes to syntax and default libraries

quick facts
-----------

+ comments - lines start with #

+ print()
	- prints a value to console over stdout
	- same as cout

+ declare and assign in a single step
	x = 5, **not** int x; x = 5;

no compile step

Types
-----

+ Numbers
	- Int (Integer) - 5,6,7,etc
	- Float (Floating point) - 5.6

+ Boolean
	- True
	- False

+ str - String
	- single or double quotes
	  * "frog", 'frog'
	  * '',""
	  * "frog's leg" <-- double quotes good for apostrophe
	- Iterable
	- **no** character type, just single-char strings

+ None
	- None

Built-in Data Structures
------------------------

## List (list)

- Iterable
- Mutable sequence of elements
	* x=[1]
	* x.append(2) -- x==[1,2]

- Elements may be of differing types
  * Ex:
		```
		[1,2,3]
		[1,2,3,"frog"]
		[]
		```

- Indexing
	* begins at 0
	* index must be an Int

- slices
	* x[0:2] [included(0):**excluded**]
	* returns a **shallow** copy
	* start copying at the first slice index
	* stop before end
	* x[3:1] --[], needs other parameter to step backwards
	* x[3:3] --[], evaluation stops before including first element

- Negative indexing
	* counts from end of list
	* x[-1] --last element


## Tuple (tuple)

- Iterable
- immutable sequence of elements
- elements *can* have different types
- (x,) -- comma **required**
- () -- valid tuple, for some reason
- tuples can contain other tuples
- lists in tuples can be modified
- slicing
	works the same as a list


## Dictionary (dict)
- heavily abused
- Iterable(key by default)
- maps keys to values
	* both keys and values can vary in type
- _**not**_ a sequence
	* cannot depend on keys in any order
- examples:
	```
	x={'a':'frog','b':'giraffe','c':'apple'}
	x['a'] -- "frog"
	x['nope'] -- KeyError
	```


## Custom Types
- they exist
- Python has class-based objects


Assignment
----------

- Variables are _dynamically_ typed
	* It'll let you do this
	* It'll work
		 * Until it doesn't.


Unpacking
---------

- multiple assignments on one line
	 * ex
		 ```
		(a,b) = (1,2)
		a,b = 1,2
		a,b = [1,2]
		a,b = b,a
		```

- numbers need to match
	* a,b,c = 1,2 --PROBLEM
