# IBM Expands Watson into Cybersecurity Amid Corporate and Government Interest

IBM’s advanced AI, Watson, has won Jeopardy multiple times and is currently working on finding better treatments for patients with cancer.
Now Watson has a new role as an advanced cybersecurity advisor and analyst for the government and corporations alike.
Watson will be used to analyze millions of documents and terabytes of data describing a network to discover errors and inconsistencies that a roomful of human analysts might not see.
After analysis, Watson creates a report detailing all potential threats and vulnerabilities on that specific network.
By allowing Watson, rather than a human, to do all of the “heavy lifting”, companies can be assured that their data is secure much sooner and have greater confidence in the accuracy of the network sweep.
Watson remembers the results of previous network sweeps and applies machine learning techniques to its findings to improve its analysis capabilities.

The primary buyer of this advanced security service is large corporations and governments which regularly experience attacks on their networks.
In an interview with Forbes' Alex Konrad, an IBM representative reported that a customer tested Watson head to head with traditional methods
and “discovered attacks on 34 of the company’s laptops [that, to a] security analyst without Watson’s data, looked like false positives.”

President Trump’s administration has made investing in cybersecurity one of its major goals, enlisting former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani an advisor to President Trump on the issue.
President Trump has already signed one executive order (order 33) calling for improving the critical cyber-infrastructure of the nation's primary systems.
In addition to executive order 33, he has also issued a memorandum elevating the U. S. Cyber Command from a sub-Unified Combatant Unit of the NSA to a full Unified Combat Command, concentrating cybersecurity issues under one division.
IBM hopes that the Trump administration will look to IBM as a business partner in enhancing the security architecture of the U. S. government and its respective divisions.
